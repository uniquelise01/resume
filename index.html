                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I never struggled trying to decide what to study in school because I was interested in <em>too</em> many things. <strong>I've always had a sweet spot for the arts;</strong> I've played piano since I was seven and took vocal lessons all through high school (I qualified for the State Choir twice!). I'm an avid reader and I love to write, to the point that I considered studying English or creative writing in school. But a psychology class my senior year led me to pursue a psych degree instead.<br><br>But my dad was always a fantastic artist, and he saw potential in me. He recommended I try out something in web or graphic design, so I took an intro class for both my first semester. <strong>And you know what? I <em>loved</em> it. </strong>I took more classes, declared myself a web design minor. A year or so later I was loving it so much that I said, "What the heck, why don't I just study this?" So I did. And if my college didn't have a 140 credit limit I would take every class they had under the subject.<br><br>In my leisure, I enjoy playing ukulele, learning French, knitting, writing stories, and playing Minecraft. But there's plenty more I want to learn how to do, and not enough time for any of it!</p>

                <h2>This Site</h2>
                <p>Yes, I designed this site myself, entirely from scratch. Did I get lots of help from the internet? Heck yeah. But I didn't want anything to be copied and pasted. All the work hear is my own, with icons and images credited in the footer.<br><br><strong>The website is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and javascript</strong>, my three strongest languages. I built all the CSS for mobile first, using media queries for medium and large viewports. I'm fascinated by CSS animations, which you might notice across all of my pages, but I'm still quite an amateur with them. Most of the coding I used for the transforms, transitions, etc. were based off internet examples.<br><br>A link to the original site plan is included in the footer, however you may notice significant differences between the wireframes and the finished site. I anticipated this, but didn't have the motivation to go back and edit the wireframes once the site was complete. You can be the judge on whether or not my final product was an improvement form the original design.<br><br>For more of my web design and development projects, visit my portfolio page.</p>
