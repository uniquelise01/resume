            <h3>Purpose and Audience</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to function as an interactive resume site. In this way, my audience of potential employers can not only read about my experience and education, but also see a real-world application in the medium by which I presented it. I hope to show my skill in not only web building from scratch, but also my design skills.</p>

            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <p>Header Type: Kaisei Decol</p>
            <p>Body Type: Source Sans Pro <br><br> Some example text for a paragraph that doesn't exist. It would probably be better and more efficient to use lorem ipsum, but I was too lazy to look around and find a lorem-ipsum copy/paste, although upon reflection it would probably end up taking the same amount of time that it took me to write this example paragraph.</p>
